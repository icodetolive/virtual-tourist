This project demonstrates and app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

##Summary

It demonstrates following concepts:
* NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API
* A user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
* Stores media on the device file system 
* Uses Core Data for local persistence of an object structure and plist persistence of an array of dictionaries

##Development Environment

IDE: Xcode 7.3 Language: Swift 2.2
